### Series Finder Backend
The Series Finder Backend is a Node.js application that allows users to search for series by keyword. It relies on the TMDB API to provide series data.

### Setup
To run this application locally:
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies using npm install.
3. Sign up at TMDB to get your API private key.
4. Create a file named .env in the root directory of the cloned repository and add TMDB_API_KEY=YOUR_API_PRIVATE_KEY, then save the file.
### Usage
Run npm start.
Access the application in your browser at http://localhost:8080 or use a tool like Postman.
Once the backend is set up, proceed to set up the [Series Finder Frontend](https://github.com/nabilsaiyan/series-finder-frontend) if you haven't done so already.
